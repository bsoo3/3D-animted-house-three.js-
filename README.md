# 3D-animted-house-three.js-

Hi

This is my first three.js project inside the folder is all the stuff you need

What you  need to do is:
  -download the 3D house folder and slide it into visual studio code.   
  -download an extension in vs code called LIVE SERVER
  -when you have downloaded the extension go to you index.html, right click in the code and click on "OPEN WITH LIVE SERVER" 
  -thats it!
  
I hope you like the code!
